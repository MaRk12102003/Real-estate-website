                    Smart City Definition 
                    There are a number of definitions of what makes a city ‘smart,’ for example ,
                    IBM defines a smart city as “one that makes optimal use of all the interconnected
                    information available today to better understand and control its operations and 
                    optimise the use of limited resources.”
                    However, in short, a smart city uses a framework of information and communication 
                    technologies to create, deploy and promote development practices to address urban 
                    challenges and create a joined-up technologically-enabled and sustainable 
                    infrastructure.

                    Smart cities use a variety of software, user interfaces and communication networks
                    alongside the Internet of Things (IoT) to deliver connected solutions for the public.
                    Of these, the IoT is the most important. The IoT is a network of connected devices 
                    that communicate and exchange data. This can include anything from vehicles to home 
                    appliances and on-street sensors. Data collected from these devices is stored in the 
                    cloud or on servers to allow for improvements to be made to both public and private 
                    sector efficiencies and deliver economic benefits and improvements to the lives of 
                    citizens.
                    Many of the IoT devices use edge computing, which ensures that only the most relevant 
                    and important data is delivered over the communication network. In addition, a security
                    system is implemented to protect, monitor and control the transmission of data from the 
                    smart city network and prevent unauthorised access to the IoT network of city’s data 
                    platform.
                    Alongside the IoT solutions, smart cities also use technologies including:

                    In April, Fitch affirmed Egypt’s rating at B+, praising its “large economy with robust 
                    growth and strong support from bilateral and multilateral partners.” More than 15% of 
                    the Egyptian economy is directly related to construction, notes Allam. “When this segment 
                    of business sees historic growth, as it has in the last eight years, it drives the economy,
                    creates job opportunities and enhances quality of life.”

                    “Cairo is a historic city and was built piece by piece, and decade by decade,” comments Allam.
                    “To move into the modern world, you need modern infrastructure.”
                    Located 45 kilometers east of the bustling Cairo metropolis, a new vision for urban living in 
                    the 21st century is taking shape. The New Administration Capital (NAC) sits at the heart of 
                    Egypt’s smart cities program.
                    
                    As Greater Cairo has grown to a conurbation of more than 20 million residents, the NAC is 
                    Egypt’s response to its population growth and the need to create sustainable communities.
                    Positioned to become the sustainability capital of the Middle East, the NAC will be home to 
                    key government ministries and foreign embassies. “The government designed a new city [that is] 
                    technologically-advanced with state-of-the-art buildings and infrastructure,” says Allam, adding 
                    that connectivity and ease of doing business are priorities.
                    
                    Strategic communications, modern transportation systems and renewable energy supplies are central 
                    to the program. “When it comes to infrastructure, plenty of work has been happening to connect 
                    cities,” explains Al-Mashat. “This is crucial for transportation of people and businesses to ease 
                    and facilitate connectivity. What is happening now in transportation—high-speed lines, monorails, 
                    trains, buses—is a complete change. The same goes for energy, digital and telecoms”.

                    Beyond Cairo and the NAC, smart cities are being built across Egypt—from New Alamein and New 
                    Mansoura on the Mediterranean coast to New Luxor in the south. “The idea is to modernize the 
                    different areas within the country,” explains Al-Mashat, who emphasizes the key role of digitalization 
                    and smart technologies in these new urban zones.
                    
                    New Alamein is one of the most ambitious of Egypt’s smart cities, covering 50,000 acres and with 
                    a proposed population of 3 million. It is being styled as Egypt’s “Gate to Africa” and combines 
                    tourist, residential and historic sectors. The city’s distinctive features include Al-Alamein Towers,
                     a series of 170-meter skyscrapers which will be the tallest on the Mediterranean coast.
                    
                    At New Mansoura, which will be home to more than 1 million, a spectacular Nile Corniche is being 
                    constructed, along with a 2-kilometer tourist marina. The smart city will have its own international 
                    university, a medical city, scientific research centers and tech zones.
                    
                    “These new fourth-generation cities have everything you can possibly imagine that would be required 
                    for a high quality of life,” says Allam. “We’ve delivered large infrastructure projects, such as 
                    water treatment plants, waste treatment facilities, and roads. We are currently building headquarters 
                    for banks and financial institutions.”
                    
                    The requirement for a high quality of life is incorporated into the cities’ infrastructure. 
                    The smart cities are “green in nature”, Al-Mashat emphasizes. The NAC will incorporate an area of 
                    open water—the Green River—as well as parklands, botanical gardens and an arboretum. It will act as 
                    the lungs of the city and be double the size of New York’s Central Park.
                    
                    A talent pipeline for modern industry
                    Smart cities also need skilled workers. People are at the core of the Cities of the Future program, 
                    which recognizes the requirement for high-quality education and a talent pipeline for modern industry.
                    Part of the government’s program of structural reform focuses on ICT training and the development of 
                    STEM (science, engineering, technology and mathematics) schools. The NAC, for example, will be home to 
                    six universities that put an emphasis on vocational training.
                    
                    “One of the most important things, is adding new graduates, focusing on the training and investment in 
                    our people. Our main vocational schools spread all over Egypt,” says Elsewedy. “The young generation 
                    in Egypt is more than 60% of the population—we have to think of the future and a better life for them.”
                    
                    Powering the new cities will be made easier by Egypt’s progress in expanding its clean energy supply, 
                    its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy has set a renewable energy target of 42% of total generation 
                    by 2035—rapidly going from “deficit to surplus” as an electricity provider, comments Al-Mashat.
                    
                    “After several years of shortages in electricity, today, Egypt is able to export electricity. There are 
                    transmission channels to Libya and to Jordan, and through Saudi Arabia to the Gulf and to Sudan,” she 
                    says. “What has been done in the last six years is extraordinary—the improvement in [Egypt’s] electricity 
                    supply from 15,000–20,000 MW to now 60,000 MW,” adds Elsewedy.
                    
                    Since 2015, Egypt has been transforming its energy sector, enacting a renewable energy law, phasing out 
                    fuel subsidies, and introducing a solar Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) program to leverage private sector capital.
                    
                    Powering change
                    Thanks to its new network of fourth-generation cities, Egypt is well placed to attract more overseas 
                    investment. “Egypt is the dream of any international company,” Elsewedy adds. “Wherever you want to 
                    invest, you’ll find the opportunity in Egypt.”
                    
                    Al-Mashat notes the crucial role of the private sector in Egypt’s progress. “Key in all of this is that 
                    the government understands the importance of private sector engagement.”
                    
                    Allam agrees that Egypt is “ripe for growth” and predicts that “FDI will come” because the country’s 
                    smart cities point the way to sustainable development. “Once you see these cities occupied with people 
                    living, working and going to school, that is success,” he says. “These cities will then develop on their 
                    own by the sheer momentum of people living there and wanting to grow.”
